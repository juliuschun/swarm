❯ after you've read all these documentation : you must think like a cynic, as well as a very intelligent planner.

  my core principle is these:

  that we can use a mix of some intelligent agents.
  #1 rule : that fast agents can think about the same topic in parallel, and we could gather and score their 집단지성. and that is usually a better decision maker than a single smart
  agent/model.
  #2 rule : we should intelligently divide tasks in small pieces. maybe the small pieces should be handled with the #1 rule - using multiple parallel agents and than gathering their
  opinions on how to handle these stuff - in a code based way that shoots out agents and handle them.
  #3 rule : we should always gather information from a previous loop and compound the learnings from them. when we learn something, we should record, and never do the same mistake.

  in other words, i would like my swarm of agents to work with multiple crowd sourced decision making, and then record the learnings and 시행착오, just like human societies do. I just want
  to make this happen faster in a loop and more concise and organized.

  i want to perhaps make this in a bash command, or something really simple and architecturally beautiful. now I need your ideas. maybe use 10 subagents to think about ideas to do this and
  you gather the best ideas.
